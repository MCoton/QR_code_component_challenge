## My process
Clearly a centred component so started with a container div that was then set "margin: 0 auto". The spec said the mobile width was 375px so made that the width of this element.
Added the remaining components as they appear, image first, then call to action and instructions. The last two in p elements.
Once the elements were in the right vertical positions moved on to fonts, added a link to Google Fonts for the "Outfit" family.
Sized and styled the instructions text according the style guide, then, giving the call to action a font weight of 700, worked backwards to find a good font size for it.
Worked on positioning next, lots of tweaking of padding to replicate the positioning in the example images.
Rounded out the img element and container div corners and set the padding.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Primarily how difficult it is to replicate a design from a screenshot. My main lesson is that it doesn't have to be pixel perfect to be "right" or "good".
I tried to keep the HTML and CSS as simple as possible, not sure I managed it!


### Continued development

More CSS, use of Flex, Grid and JavaScript, maybe Bootstrap or a similar framework.


### Useful resources

I had to resort to this at one point, it is always a useful resource
